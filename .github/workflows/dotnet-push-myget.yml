      # A common error is "source not found".  But what that can really mean is that the API token was null/empty.
      # This can happen if MYGET_DEPLOY_API_KEY_SECRET is not shared to the repository from the org-level secrets.
      # You should at the "env:" section to verify that the API token variable has a value like:
      #     env:
      #       NUGET_AUTH_TOKEN: ***
