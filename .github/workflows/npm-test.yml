# Execute '`npm run test`' against the package.json file.  There is support 
# for package.json files that are named otherwise or do not exist at the 
# root of the repository.  This workflow *only* runs the build script.
# 
# Note: This restores the workspace created in the npm-build.yml job 
# before executing the test script.
